# Scan Docker Images

[![Tests Passing](https://github.com/spicyparrot/scan-images/actions/workflows/create_tag.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spicyparrot/scan-images/actions/workflows/create_tag.yml)

This is a composite action that uses the the excellent [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy) by Aqua Security to scan in-memory docker images for security issues.

This can be used to flag security issues prior to pushing to an image registry, such as Docker Hub, to further improve a shift left development life cycle.

## Key Features

- Scans any in-memory image and just public images
- Allows scanning prior to pushing
- Scan multiple images in a single task
- Generates a single report with the results of all images scanned
- Parses out the total issues found to allow for error thresholding

## Requirements

- Images to be scan available in memory prior to scanning
